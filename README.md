# Netflix_World_Traveler
My personal Netflix project--for educational purposes only<br>
Complete version coming soon!<br>
In the meantime, here's the storyboard.<br>
<br>
(1) This project analyzes my Netflix <i>ViewingActivity.csv</i> file, which contains over 18,000 records! The focus is on what I think may be Netflix’s best-kept secret–-the existence of hundreds of original TV series from countries all over the world!<br>
